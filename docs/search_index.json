[["image-analysis.html", "Chapter 14 Image Analysis", " Chapter 14 Image Analysis 14.0.1 Case Study: Ice Change Analysis Case Study Author: Natasha Sharma (CC BY 4.0. unless otherwise indicated), University of British Columbia, Bachelors of Environment and Sustainability, 2022 Landsat 8-7 has regularly acsquired images of Beaufort Sea and Mackenzie River Delta through true-color image to show abundance surface melt, fast ice break up, leaf fraction, ice motion, and changes in coastal features during early springtime. The Beaufort Sea has seen dramatic summer ice losses, particularly in 2009, with regions that were dominated by thick multi-year ice now completely melting out. For comparison, the timeline GIF from 1992 to 2021 depicts different stages of ice breakup in the month of June. Notice the extensive fracturing of Beaufort Sea ice occurring in 1996, but the 2009 and 2014 fracturing appears more widespread until nearly disappearing in 2017.

Similarly, in the high arctic polar desert of Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada, what were once the twin St.Patrick Bay ice caps have now chipped away due to decades of rising temperatures and unusually warm summers. Once the remnants of the Little Ice Age that covered about 7.5 square km and 3 square km across respectively, the formation has reduced to only 5% of their former area and are predicted to extinct within a decade. St.Patrick Bay Ice caps are emblematic of the Arctic change - a reality of how climate change is affecting the whole of Canadian Arctic. #container{position:relative;top: 0; left: 0;} #before-img{width:100%;top: 0; left:0; position:absolute;clip-path: polygon(0 0 , 50% 0, 50% 100%, 0 100%);} #after-img{ position:relative; top:0; left:0;width:100%;}#slider{ position: absolute; top:0; left:0; -webkit-appearance: none; width: calc(100% + 40px); height: 100%; margin-left: -20px; background-color: transparent; outline: none; } #slider::-webkit-slider-thumb{ -webkit-appearance: none; height: 40px; width: 40px; background: url(\"./images/scroll-icon.png\"); background-size: contain; cursor: pointer; } "]]
