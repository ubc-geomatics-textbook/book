<p>The result of capability modelling is a binary classification of features or cells in a raster: 1 or 0; yes or no; true or false; capable or not capable. Recall from Chapter 3 that ordinal data scales are used to rank or order categorical or qualitative data elements. Even with just two classes, a capability map uses an ordinal data scale because 1 (capable) is better than 0 (not capable).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Suitability modelling<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#suitability-modelling" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Suitability modelling</strong> is an extension of capability modelling that tells us how suitable a particular activity is for a given location. In other words, capability modelling gives us the spatial options that meet some minimum criteria and suitability modelling allows us to rank those options based on some attributes in our spatial data. From our earlier example, suppose we have identified 8 areas that are possible options for conserving habitat (i.e., capable), but we might only have the budget to proactively manage a few of these areas. So where should we prioritize our conservation and management activities? This is a question for suitability modelling!</p>
<p>Once we have calculated capability as an ordinal scale value (1 or 0), we can then use another set of attributes to calculate a <strong>suitability score</strong> for the capable areas. Frequently, the suitability score takes the form of a continuous ratio scale with values between <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\([0,100]\)</span> because we want to be able to place every capable feature on a spectrum from “least suitable” (0) to “most suitable” (1 or 100) based on some set of attributes. The calculation for the suitability score can take many forms and is dependent on the spatial problem that you are trying to solve. Some attributes can be used individually as a suitability score. For example, if bigger is better, then you could simply sort your capable features by area and you would have a suitability score on a continuous ratio scale, no further calculation needed. More commonly, we want to combine several attributes together in our scoring, which might represent data in different scales. Next, we will walk through an example for calculating a suitability score with nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data scales.</p>
<p>Suppose bigger really is better, so the area of the capable polygons will be one of our attributes for our suitability score, which is a ratio data scale. (By the way, you can extend this logic to lines and points as well: longer lines are preferred or a higher density of points is preferred.) Our first step here is to normalize these ratio data to a range of <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> using the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
X_{normalized} = (X-X_{min})/(X_{max}-X_{min})
\]</span></p>
<p>This is also called a min-max normalization, because the maximum value will be equal to 1 and the minimum value will be equal to 0:</p>

<p>Maybe our species is also found in several possible habitats. Habitat cover is a nominal data scale (e.g., “forest”, “wetland”, “non-forest”). If we know that our species is found in “forest” 60% of the time, in “wetland” 30% of the time, and in “non-forest” 10% of the time, then we can actually convert these nominal habitat covers into a ratio scale (i.e., 0.6, 0.3 and 0.1). In the case that you do not have additional numerical data to make this conversion, you could also make an educated guess and assign weights to your classes that sum to 1. For example, based on the literature, we might hypothesize that our species has preferences for “forest”, “wetland”, and “non-forest” that can be quantified with the weights 0.5, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively. Either approach is sensible, as long as you are transparent about your choice. diuygudd</p>

<p>Maybe we also have land use intensities representing human activity and management that are classified as “high”, “medium”, and “low”. These land use intensities are an ordinal data scale. Frequently, ordinal data scales in geomatics are derived from some other numerical analysis. For example, land use intensity may have initially been mapped from the density of roads in an area or the frequency of a particular industrial activity, which was then classified into “high”, “medium”, and “low” intensity classes. It is worth looking at the documentation of the mapped data you are working with to see how the ordinal data were generated and what assumptions went into the terms used (i.e., “high”, “medium”, and “low”). For our example, let us assume that we know nothing numerically about these land use intensities, just that “high” is worse for the conservation of our species than “low”. If we return to our original question, <strong>where should we prioritize our conservation and management activities?</strong>, then most likely our efforts will be best spent conserving areas that currently have high land use intensity. In this case, we can convert these ordinal data into ratio data by assigning weights that sum to 1. For example, “high” is 0.8, “medium” is 0.15, and “low” is 0.05.</p>

<p>Maybe we also have dates that represent the last year of a known disturbance like a fire. Dates are an interval data scale, but can easily be converted into a ratio scale by subtracting them from the current date to yield a measure of time-since something. For example, time-since last fire might be a good proxy for forage quality of our species regardless of the habitat cover. Once we have converted it to a ratio scale, we want to normalize it to a range of <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, but suppose that more recent fire is better. In this case, we also need to reverse the range so that the oldest fire has a lower score than the most recent fire. We can achieve this by modifying the min-max equation so that we subtract <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(X_{max}\)</span>:</p>

X_{normalized,reversed} = (X_{max}-X)/(X_{max}-X_{min})

<p>Now we can put all the rescaled attributes together, add them up for each capable area, and divide by the total number of attributes that we used in our scoring process (four). This gives us an arithmetic mean that ranges between <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> because all the other attributes also use this range. Sometimes this score is multiplied by 100 to convert the ratios into percentages. We can then sort the capable polygons in descending order by our suitability score:</p>

<p>We can see from the above suitability analysis that capable polygon number 8 has the highest overall suitability. It is important to highlight two points here: the suitability score is unitless (after all, we have combined four very different data scales together); and the scores are on the same ratio scale, which means they can be directly compared. In other words, the most suitable location is more than twice as suitable as the least suitable location, based on the criteria and scoring scheme we used.</p>
<p>Note that the choice of weights for ordinal and nominal data scales are arbitrary, but these numbers can be based on a hypothesis, other numerical data, or your project’s values. You can also iterate the suitability scoring process with different weights for ordinal and nominal scale data so that you achieve your desired project outcomes such as statistical distribution of scores or frequency of scores above a particular threshold value. For example, if you are trying to simultaneously solve the related question, <strong>I have X dollars, how should I allocate them?</strong>, then you might run a cost analysis that uses attributes accounting for the cost of intervening at a location. If you can convert your attributes into a dollar (ratio) scale, then you can simply add everything together to get the total cost for the activity at any given location.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that we know that our conservation intervention costs $10,000 per hectare and we have a total budget of $150,000 to conserve 15 total hectares. Looking at the capable areas in the earlier table, the total area that <strong>could</strong> be conserved is 44.22 hectares, which exceeds our budget. We need to solve two things: <strong>where are our conservation efforts going to have the most impact on the species?</strong> and <strong>how can we allocate our budget efficiently to achieve that impact?</strong> We have already solved the first problem, and the second problem is a matter of relating the costs to the suitability analysis, sorting the table based on the suitability score from our solution to the first problem, and then calculating a cumulative cost field that adds up the costs of the capable features in descending order of their suitability. This produces the following table:</p>

<p>We can now see that prioritizing the top three suitable areas <span class="math inline">\(ID = {8,7,1}\)</span> for our conservation intervention will cost $149,900, nearly exhausting our budget with $100 left over for a party to celebrate the geomatics team. This is just one example of how cartographic modelling can provide powerful answers to very real spatial questions. Can you think of other mapped attributes, besides area, that could factor into this conservation cost analysis?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Overlay Methods<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#overlay-methods" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In the above example, the data were provided already compiled. However, we often have to gather data ourselves. Overlay methods allow us to get more information about a spatial area, based on other spatial attributes or other mapped features. One example of a suitability analysis would be an equity analysis. These analyses exist for many areas all across the globe. Ottawa, Ontario, for example, has a Neighborhood Equity Index (NEI). Ottawa’s NEI looks at several variables to assess the equity of Ottawa’s census tracts. The NEI was published in 2021 using data from 2019 with the goal of improving Ottawa’s decision-making. The 17 variables used to develop the NEI fit into five broad domains: economic opportunity; social and human development; physical environment; health; and community and belonging (read more about the NEI here: <a href="https://neighbourhoodequity.ca/">https://neighbourhoodequity.ca/</a>)</p>
<p>While the NEI is valuable and answers questions about the general well-being of citizens, it could be improved by the addition of cultural components. As it stands, the only cultural well-being component is citizens’ geographic proximity to community centres, which is in the physical environment domain.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you aimed to include citizens’ exposure to cultural services. Such services could be public art, green spaces, street trees, and other points of interest. The developers of the NEI did consider the amount of usable green space within walking distance. However, that value did not make it into the final index.</p>
<p>For the rest of this chapter, we will develop a cultural equity index for Ottawa. The index can be developed at several scales: are you concerned with the city as a whole? Wards? Census tracts? Or are you assessing the service-providing assets individually? The answer to this is dependent on the question. For the following example, the study scale will be based on Ottawa’s Wards in urban and suburban areas.</p>
<p>We would start by downloading all of the necessary data we wish to work with. We will be working with several datasets: Ottawa’s Urban Boundary; Ottawa’s Wards; Street Trees; Parks and Greenspaces; and the Neighbourhood Equity Index (NEI) in Ottawa. All of these data can be found in Ottawa’s Open Data Portal (<a href="https://open.ottawa.ca/">https://open.ottawa.ca/</a>).</p>
<div id="clip" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Clip<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#clip" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A <em>clip</em> is effectively a cookie-cutter, where the boundaries of the clipping features become the boundaries of the input features. However, a clip does not transfer attributes of the clipping file to the clipped product. Additionally, fields such as area or any fields that depended on the prior area of the features must be recalculated after a clip because the areas of the polygons will have changed. For example, if some census tract polygons included data about number of people living within the polygons, then you clip those polygons, the same number of people in that attribute will be carried forward to the newly clipped features, but the attribute value will be invalid for the new area.</p>
<p>Ottawa’s open data catalogue contains a dataset with the “urban boundaries” of the city. This dataset consists of one polygon and no additional information within the attribute table. If we wished to solely work within Ottawa’s urban boundaries without suburban distinctions, we would clip the data we have so far to the urban boundary. However, we want to differentiate between different community types within Ottawa. Therefore, we must use a different tool.</p>

<p><strong>Dissolve</strong> combines polygons with a shared attribute value together. A dissolve can be used to summarize data by a common attribute.</p>
<p>If you look at Figure <a href="#fig:6-urbanboundary-leaflet"><strong>??</strong></a>, what do you notice about the landscape within and outside of the urban border? There is a lot of agricultural land within the City of Ottawa! The large amount of rural area within Ottawa makes it a demographically unique city. However, analysis of cultural services is substantially different in rural areas than it is in urban areas. The NEI included all areas within Ottawa regardless of community type, but our analysis will not. Our analysis will focus solely on the urban and suburban areas within Ottawa. Therefore, we must classify our wards (study areas) by their level of urbanization. Then, we will remove the areas that are not urban or suburban (such as rural areas and those classified as greenbelt). The NEI dataset comprehensively classifies the areas within Ottawa as urban, suburban, rural, greenbelt, etc. However, we do not need to have our data divided into as many polygons as the NEI dataset. Therefore, we will reduce the amount of polygons (and therefore the amount of data and processing power) by using the dissolve method.</p>

<p>The dissolve field we will use is <strong>URB_RURAL</strong> (the classification of Community Type). We will create multipart features for this dissolve. Multipart features are features that have multiple distinct geometries, but are considered as one feature, whether or not they are adjacent. They are further discussed in <a href="https://www.opengeomatics.ca/topology-and-geocoding.html#multipart-geometry">Chapter 7</a>. After the dissolve, there are now six features rather than 196. As can be seen in the attribute table, the number of rows changes from 196 to 6 and the number of columns decreases from 26 to 3.
Additionally, the file size is halved. Removing extraneous data allows for easier analyses later on. In this example, multipart features were created. If they had not been, there would have been 96 features. When a feature class with multipart features was created, why do you think the number of features decreases to exactly six? It’s because there are six classes of community types!</p>

<div id="intersect" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3</span> Intersect<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#intersect" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>An <strong>intersect</strong> is an overlay between two feature classes that overlap and results in a feature class with the attributes from both input relations.</p>
<p>For this assessment, we want to divide our study area into urban and suburban areas and exclude the rural ones. Therefore, it makes more sense for us to do an <em>intersect</em> than a <em>clip</em> as mentioned above.</p>
<p>We will select the polygons that are classified as urban and suburban, and then intersect these with Ottawa’s wards. This will give us a dataset with the urban and suburban extent of Ottawa’s wards. You can see that some wards are both urban and suburban.[highlight this with an image]</p>
<p>NOTE: The urban and suburban boundaries according to the NEI differ from those on Ottawa’s website. The boundaries of “urban” are not always easily defined and are often specified as a result of geopolitical reasons. For example, the “urban” area as specified by the City of Ottawa is where urban development is legally allowed to happen (<a href="https://open.ottawa.ca/datasets/ottawa" class="uri">https://open.ottawa.ca/datasets/ottawa</a>).</p>

<p>Tree trees provide many benefits to neighbourhoods, so we want to assess the amount (in relative area) of street trees in each ward. Ottawa has an extensive city-wide tree inventory, containing over 275,000 trees maintained by the city.
This results in a dataset much larger than what we need. Therefore, we will use clip to reduce the number of features in our Tree Inventory shapefile. We will clip the tree inventory (input features) with the urban and suburban boundaries (clip feature). Now the clipped tree inventory only has the city-maintained trees within the urban and suburban areas of Ottawa.</p>

<div id="buffer" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.5</span> Buffer<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#buffer" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A <strong>buffer</strong> is a polygon zone around an input feature. Input features could be points, lines or polygons. To create the buffer, a distance must be specified from the input feature. Buffering is a type of proximity analysis.</p>
<p>Green spaces provide valuable cultural ecosystem services. Green spaces affect the area around them through cooling, viewing, and the ability to recreate. While we could solely assess the amount of green space compared to the amount of area in a ward, we would not be taking the total area influenced by local green spaces into account. Instead, we will look at the proportion of the ward that is within 100 meters of a green space. To do this, we will create buffers of 100 meters around the green spaces.</p>
</div>
<div id="attribute-dependent-buffer" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.6</span> Attribute-dependent buffer<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#attribute-dependent-buffer" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The distance of a buffer can also be specified according to an attribute value. So-called <strong>attribute-dependent buffers</strong> are used when features are better represented with differently-sized zones. Approximating the space represented by objects like tree canopies that have different sizes is an example of an attribute-dependent buffer use case. We already have a way to estimate the amount of area in each ward that is affected by greenspace. Now we want to understand how much treed space is within each ward.</p>
<p>Many of the trees in the Ottawa street trees have diameter values. For this example, we will assume that every tree without a diameter value above zero has a diameter of ten centimeters. To do so, we will select for diameter values of zero or below and will set those values to ten. Then, we will use these values to create attribute-dependent buffers to represent tree canopy sizes. The values do not actually represent true crown area. Because we are completing a comparative analysis between wards, “true” values are not necessary. We will dissolve the buffers so that overlapping tree canopies do not get counted twice.</p>

<div id="near" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.7</span> Near<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#near" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Near</strong> calculates the distance from one feature to another feature.</p>
<p>We are specifically interested in Ottawa’s street trees, not the park trees or other city-maintained trees. To better assess the relative area of street trees, we want to be sure that we are only using trees along streets in our analysis. The tree inventory dataset contains city-maintained trees, not only street trees. We will use the near tool on the clipped tree inventory feature class to determine the distance threshold to identify street trees, that is, trees that are near streets.</p>

<div id="eliminate" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.8</span> Eliminate<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#eliminate" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Post-dissolve, we would have expected the number of rows in the attribute table to reduce significantly. However, this was not the case. This is because there are many tiny slivers left or small portions of polygons. You can think of these are the “scraps” of all of our cookie cutting. We can <strong>eliminate</strong> these slivers and clean up the dataset by merging them with the largest adjacent polygon or a nearby polygon that shares a particular attribute value.</p>
</div>
<div id="identity" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="6.2.9">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.9</span> Identity<a href="overlay-and-proximity-analysis.html#identity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Identity</strong> is another form of overlay that is the spatial equivalent of a left or right outer join. In other words, we features in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are first intersected with features in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then only features that were also originally in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are transferred to the output C. Identity supports attribute transfer such that the attributes in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are joined with the attributes in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. However, there may be some features in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> that do not intersect with features in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, in which case, the values of the transferred attributes from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be <span class="math inline">\(NULL\)</span> or not defined.</p>
<p>The area of street trees is more powerful when compared to the length of streets in each ward. Rather than working with the absolute area, we will be calculating the relative area. To do this, we will calculate an identity to assign a ward to each section of street in the Ottawa streets feature class Then, we will use summary statistics to calculate the length of street in each ward. With that value, we will divide the area of street trees by the length of street to get the relative area of street trees per street.</p>
