## 10.1 Introduction{-}

Like any other data, spatial data will only make true sense if we could perform some level of spatial analysis with it.Spatial analysis will allow to understand where and what is occurring in the area of your interest. The major inherent limitations that a spatial data carry is the unobserved location within a study area.

While needing to account for additional variables about a location may be intimidating, many spatial statistic processes are quite similar to basic statistical methods. For example, interpolation and spatial regression can help you estimate or predict the value of a variable in a sample location. Similarly, spatial autocorrelation measures the degree of similarity between sample locations just like typical autocorrelation is done.
