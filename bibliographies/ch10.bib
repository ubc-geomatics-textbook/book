	abstract = {This article presents a discussion of mixed methods (MM) sampling techniques. MM sampling involves combining well-established qualitative and quantitative techniques in creative ways to answer research questions posed by MM research designs. Several issues germane to MM sampling are presented including the differences between probability and purposive sampling and the probability-mixed-purposive sampling continuum. Four MM sampling prototypes are introduced: basic MM sampling strategies, sequential MM sampling, concurrent MM sampling, and multilevel MM sampling. Examples of each of these techniques are given as illustrations of how researchers actually generate MM samples. Finally, eight guidelines for MM sampling are presented. © 2007, SAGE Publications.

	abstract = {Background: Most studies among Hispanics have focused on individual risk factors of obesity, with less attention on interpersonal, community and environmental determinants. Conducting community based surveys to study these determinants must ensure representativeness of disparate populations. We describe the use of a novel Geographic Information System (GIS)-based population based sampling to minimize selection bias in a rural community based study. Methods: We conducted a community based survey to collect and examine social determinants of health and their association with obesity prevalence among a sample of Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites living in a rural community in the Southeastern United States. To ensure a balanced sample of both ethnic groups, we designed an area stratified random sampling procedure involving three stages: (1) division of the sampling area into non-overlapping strata based on Hispanic household proportion using GIS software; (2) random selection of the designated number of Census blocks from each stratum; and (3) random selection of the designated number of housing units (i.e., survey participants) from each Census block. Results: The proposed sample included 109 Hispanic and 107 non-Hispanic participants to be recruited from 44 Census blocks. The final sample included 106 Hispanic and 111 non-Hispanic participants. The proportion of Hispanic surveys completed per strata matched our proposed distribution: 7\% for strata 1, 30\% for strata 2, 58\% for strata 3 and 83\% for strata 4. Conclusion: Utilizing a standardized area based randomized sampling approach allowed us to successfully recruit an ethnically balanced sample while conducting door to door surveys in a rural, community based study. The integration of area based randomized sampling using tools such as GIS in future community-based research should be considered, particularly when trying to reach disparate populations.},

	abstract = {The disjunctive kriging (DK) method described in detail in the previous paper of this series is illustrated by two examples. The first example is for the electrical conductivity (EC) which is approximately lognormally distributed. In the second example the natural logarithm of the EC is used to produce an approximately normally distributed data set. The data set was chosen since the Hermite coefficients for a normal and lognormal distribution could be determined analytically as well as to facilitate a comparison between ordinary and disjunctive kriging. The capability of DK to be a nonlinear estimator and an estimator of the conditional probability is explored. The results indicate that DK is a better estimator than linear estimators (i.e., ordinary kriging) in the sense of reduced variance of errors and average kriging variance even when the data are approximately normally or lognormally distributed. Also, using DK one can obtain an estimate of the conditional probability. Copyright 1986 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {This book is a completely new version of the highly successful Principles of Geographical Information Systems for Land Resources Assessment which was first published in 1986. GIS are not just used for electronic map-making but today are major tools for the management of our physical and social environment. GIS are used to assist political decisions and play a part in market research, in the management of utility services, in automated navigation systems and in many other fields. This book presents a strong theoretical basis for GIS, which is often lacking in other texts. Spatial data are usually based on two, dichotomous paradigms, exactly defined entities in space, such as land parcels, or the continuous variation of single attributes, such as temperature or rainfall. Methods for modelling both kinds of phenomena and storing them in spatial databases are described in detail, including the use of geostatistics for interpolating from points to continuous fields. Examples of how spatial data and an analysis of their spatial interactions are used to solve a wide range of practical problems ranging from site-location analysis through land degradation, the optimizing of timber extraction from forests and the redistribution of Chernobyl radioactivity by floods are explained clearly and in detail. Much attention is paid to the problems of data quality and how statistical errors in spatial data can affect the results of spatial modelling based on the two paradigms of space. Fuzzy logic and continuous classification methods are presented as methods for linking the two spatial paradigms. The book concludes with an investigation of current developments in providing spatial data for the whole world over the Internet. As such the new volume provides a comprehensive and concise introduction to the theory and practice of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Targeted at undergraduates, graduates, and professionals in disciplines such as physical and human geography, hydrology, geology, environmental science, cartography, epidemiology, radioecology, agriculture, spatial planning, land tenure, and land evaluation the book explains why spatial data and the information systems based on them are important in the modern world.},

	abstract = {Before the development of the germ theory â relating microorganisms with disease transmission (1880) â people believed that diseases were transmitted by odours. Water and sewage disinfection emerged as a method for elimination of odours. There are many disinfecting agents, but chlorine is the main product used to disinfect water. Organic compounds present in water that is chlorinated can result in the formation of trihalomethanes. The latter are basically one atom of carbon, one of hydrogen, and three of a halogen (chlorine, bromine, or iodine). These are considered carcinogenic compounds and their presence in drinking water should therefore be avoided. Epidemiological research has shown an association between trihalomethane concentration and cancer morbidity and mortality for some types of carcinoma. Nevertheless, there may be more risk than benefit involved in replacing chlorine with other disinfecting agents, since the incidence of water-borne diseases only dropped after water chlorination became a routine procedure. A desinfecção da água tem sido praticada por milênios, embora os princípios envolvidos no processo não fossem conhecidos. Existem indícios de que o uso de água fervida já era recomendado em 500 a.C., mas alguns historia-dores julgam que esta prática era adotada desde o começo da civilização (Iabusch, 1971). Até que a teoria dos microorganismos fosse es-tabelecia (Louis Pasteur, 1880), havia a crença de que as doenças eram transmitidas através de odores. A desinfecção da água e dos esgotos surgiu como uma tentativa de se controlar a propagação das doenças através dos odores. DESINFECÇÃO},

	abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (â¼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30Â°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)},

The link among location indicated by a spatial weight matrix. It describe the structure of neighbouring and reflects the spatial influence. According to the spatial data, type of weighting matrix can be divided into two types: point type (distance) and the neighbourhood area (contiguity). Selection weighting function is one determinant of the results of the spatial analysis. This study use queen contiguity based on first order neighbour weights, queen contiguity based on second order neighbour weights, and inverse distance weights. Queen contiguity first order and inverse distance weights shows that there is the significance spatial autocorrelation in DHF, but not by queen contiguity second order. Queen contiguity first and second order compute 68 and 86 neighbour list.},

The purpose of this paper is to use data from the ecological literature as well as from original research to provide a comprehensive and easily understood analysis of geostatistics' manner of modeling and methods. The traditional geostatistical tool, the variogram, a tool that is beginning to be used in ecology, is shown to provide an incomplete and misleading summary of spatial pattern when local means and variances change. Use of the non-ergodic covariance and correlogram provides a more effective description of lag-to-lag spatial dependence because the changing local means and variances are accounted for. Indicator transformations capture the spatial patterns of nominal ecological variables like gene frequencies and the presence/absence of an organism and of subgroups of a population like large or small individuals. Robust variogram measures are shown to be useful in data sets that contain many data outliers. Appropriate removal of outliers reveals latent spatial dependence and patterns. Cross-variograms, cross-covariances, and cross-correlograms define the joint spatial dependence between co-occurring organisms. The results of all of these analyses bring new insights into the spatial relations of organisms in their environment.},

Initially, 400 soil samples from the Kozani area, which is near Polifitou Lake in northern Greece, were randomly collected from 2013 to 2015 and were analysed in the laboratory to determine the soil Fe concentrations and pH. The soil Fe concentrations were examined for spatial autocorrelation, and semivariograms were used to determine whether pH and Fe exhibited spatial cross correlation. Three interpolation methods, including Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging, and Co-Kriging, were applied, and their results were compared with the use of two different cross-validation methods. In the current study, there was evidence of spatial cross correlation of soil Fe and pH for each year, which was subsequently used to improve the interpolation results in locations where there were no measurements. In nearly all cases, Co-Kriging, which takes advantage of the covariance between the two regionalized variables (Fe and pH), outperformed the other interpolation techniques each year.},

	abstract = {Tree height-diameter relationships are usually studied using linear or nonlinear models, but exogenous variables, especially spatially autocorrelated and dependent variables of tree diameter or height, are not often considered in height-diameter modeling. Three types of spatial regression models - spatial lag model, spatial error model, and spatial Durbin process model - are explored in this study. The height-diameter relationships are modeled using the spatial regression models to investigate the effects of spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation and the roles of the exogenous variables generated by neighboring trees. Case study 1 shows that the spatial lag model should be used to analyze height-diameter relationships, in which heights of neighboring trees, which are exogenous variables, and the endogenous variable DBH significantly affect height growth. Case study 2 shows that the spatial error model performs better than other models, and that height growth is not only affected by its endogenous variable diameter but also by unobserved variables that vary spatially and result in residual spatial autocorrelation. Spatial regression models are an approach to height-diameter modeling that provide insight into how the endogenous variable diameter, the exogenous variables height and (or) diameter of neighboring trees, and locally varied but unobserved environmental or ecological variables contribute to height growth.},

We construct a spatial weights matrix,W, based on the principle that spatial structure should be considered in a two-part framework, those units that evoke a distance effect, and those that do not. Our two-variable local statistics model (LSM) is based on the G∗ i local statistic. The local statistic concept depends on the designation of a critical distance, dc, defined as the distance beyond which no discernible increase in clustering of high or low values exists. In a series of simulation experiments LSMis compared to well-known spatial weights matrix specifications-two different contiguity configurations, three different inverse distance formulations, and three semi-variance models. The simulation experiments are carried out on a random spatial pattern and two types of spatial clustering patterns. The LSM performed best according to the Akaike Information Criterion, a spatial autoregressive coefficient evaluation, and Moran's I tests on residuals. The flexibility inherent in the LSM allows for its favorable performance when compared to the rigidity of the global models.},

	abstract = {Spatial statistics quantify spatial pattern and identify local and global departures from null spatial models. As part of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis they play a critical role in the evaluation of spatial pattern, and in the formulation of hypotheses to explain spatial pattern. While all spatial data have imprecise locations, the magnitude of this imprecision can vary dramatically from one measuring instrument to another and from one study to another. When does location uncertainty impede our ability to quantify spatial pattern? This paper describes credibility-based spatial randomization tests that propagate location uncertainty through proximity metrics and into spatial statistics. Credibility is a flexible new approach to spatial randomization tests, but is not a panacea. It applies to spatial statistics that incorporate measures of geographic proximity (e.g. spatial adjacency, weight, nearest neighbor relationship, distance etc.). It uses Monte Carlo sampling to generate the null distribution, and not distribution theory, as classical statistics do. It is a technique for testing hypotheses regarding spatial pattern, and is best described as a method for Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis. It is meant to complement, not replace, traditional spatial statistics that use P-values and alpha levels. In conjunction with these techniques it forms a quantitative basis for evaluating the likely impact of location uncertainty on one's ability to make statistical decisions with spatial data. © 1999 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {In the Dutch sector of the North Sea, sea bird densities are recorded bi-monthly by using airborne strip-transect monitoring. From these data we try to estimate: (i) high-resolution spatial patterns of sea bird densities; (ii) low-resolution spatial-average bird densities for large areas; and (iii) temporal changes in (i) and (ii), using data on Fulmaris glacialis as an example. For spatial estimation, we combined Poisson regression for modelling the trend as a function of water depth and distance to coast with kriging interpolation of the residual variability, assuming spatial (co)variances to be proportional to the trend value. Spatial averages were estimated by block kriging. For estimating temporal differences we used residual cokriging for two consecutive years, and show how this can be extended to analyse trends over multiple years. Approximate standard errors are obtained for all estimates. A comparison with a residual simple kriging approach reveals that ignoring temporal cross-correlations leads to a severe loss of statistical accuracy when assessing the significance of temporal changes.This article shows results for Fulmaris glacialis monitored during August/September in 1998 and 1999.
